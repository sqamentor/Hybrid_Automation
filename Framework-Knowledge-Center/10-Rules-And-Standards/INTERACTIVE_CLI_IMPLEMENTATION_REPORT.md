## 🚀 User Experience Flow

### Before (Command-Line)

```bash
# User needs to know:
# - pytest command syntax
# - Project structure

### After (Interactive)

```bash
# User just types:
automation
```

Then follows visual menus:
1. **Select Project** → "BookSlot Appointment System"
2. **Select Test Suite** → "📹 Recorded Tests"
3. **Select Test File** → "test_bookslot_complete_workflow.py"
4. **Select Environment** → "STAGING"
5. **Confirm** → "Yes"
6. **Watch Tests Run** → Beautiful output!

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero technical knowledge required
- ✅ Guided step-by-step process
- ✅ Auto-discovery of tests
- ✅ Clear descriptions and help text

**Design Pattern**: Command Pattern + Strategy Pattern
- Command Pattern for CLI routing
- Strategy Pattern for test suite detection

**Key Technologies:**
- **Rich** - Terminal formatting and layout
- **Questionary** - Interactive prompts
- **PyYAML** - Configuration loading
- **Pytest** - Test execution
- **Pathlib** - File system operations

### Code Structure

```
framework/cli/
├── __init__.py           # Main CLI router (updated)
├── interactive.py        # Interactive launcher (NEW)
├── projects.py           # Project management
├── context.py            # Context detection

automation test bookslot --env staging
automation record
automation projects list
automation context
```

**New default behavior:**
```bash

   - Use direct commands for CI/CD pipelines

3. **Test Filtering**
   - Cannot filter tests by markers in interactive mode
   - Run all or select individual files only

### Planned Enhancements

- [ ] Test scheduling
- [ ] Parallel execution support
- [ ] Execution history view
- [ ] Favorites/bookmarks
- [ ] Custom test data selection
- [ ] In-terminal report viewer
