## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### For Non-Technical Users

1. **Start with Staging**
   - Always test in staging environment first
   - Production should be used carefully

2. **Run All Tests First**
   - Choose "Run All Tests" to get comprehensive results
   - Then narrow down to specific tests if needed

3. **Read Descriptions**
   - Each option has a description
   - Take time to read before selecting

4. **Use Back Navigation**
   - Made a mistake? Use "Back" option
   - No need to restart completely

5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Use arrow keys (↑/↓) to navigate
   - Press Enter to select
   - Press Ctrl+C to cancel at any time

### For Power Users

1. **Direct Commands Available**
   - Interactive mode is optional
   - Use direct commands for automation/CI:
     ```bash
     automation test bookslot --env staging
     ```

2. **Same Project Workflow**
   - When running multiple tests on same project
   - Answer "Yes" to "Continue with same project?"
   - Saves time on project selection

3. **Environment URLs**
   - URLs are displayed for verification
   - Ensure you're testing the right environment

4. **Exit Anytime**
   - Press Ctrl+C to exit immediately
   - Or select "Exit" option in menus

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Interactive mode requires additional packages"

**Problem**: Missing rich or questionary packages

**Solution**:
```bash
pip install rich questionary
```

Or install all requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "No projects found in configuration"

**Problem**: `config/projects.yaml` is missing or empty

**Solution**:
1. Check if `config/projects.yaml` exists
2. Verify project configuration
3. See [projects.yaml](../config/projects.yaml) for examples

### "No test suites found"

**Problem**: No test files detected for selected project

**Solution**:
1. Check if test files exist:
   - `recorded_tests/<project>/test_*.py`
   - `tests/modern/<project>/test_*.py`
   - `tests/legacy/<project>/test_*.py`
2. Record tests using: `automation record`
3. Or write tests manually

### Tests fail to execute

**Problem**: Pytest or environment issues

**Solution**:
1. Verify pytest is installed: `pytest --version`
2. Check environment configuration in `.env`
3. Ensure browser drivers are installed:
   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```
4. Check logs in `artifacts/logs/` for details

---

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Environment Variables

Set before launching:
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:PROJECT = "bookslot"
$env:TEST_ENV = "staging"

# Then run
automation
```

### Silent Mode (CI/CD)

For non-interactive execution in CI/CD:
```bash
# Direct command execution
automation test bookslot --env staging -v

# Or use pytest directly
pytest recorded_tests/bookslot/ --env=staging -v
```

### Custom Test Filters

After selection, pytest runs with these default options:
- `-v` - Verbose output
- `--tb=short` - Short traceback format
- `--color=yes` - Colorized output
- `--env=<selected>` - Environment selection

Modify in `framework/cli/interactive.py` if needed.
