## 🎯 TECHNICAL DEBT REGISTER (2 Items)

### **TD-001: Direct Page API Calls (~20 instances)**

**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Category**: Test Boundaries  
**Status**: 🟡 ACCEPTED (Non-blocking)  
**Target Resolution**: Q2 2026 Sprint (April-May 2026)

#### **Problem Statement**
- **Location**: `tests/test_bookslot_complete_flows.py`
- **Issue**: Test file contains ~20 direct calls to page object browser APIs (selectors, actions)
- **Example Violations**:
  ```python
  # Current (Direct API Access):
  page.locator("#firstName").fill("John")
  page.locator("#lastName").fill("Doe")
  page.locator("button[type='submit']").click()
  
  # Expected (Page Object Method):
  basic_info_page.enter_first_name("John")
  basic_info_page.enter_last_name("Doe")
  basic_info_page.click_submit_button()
  ```

#### **Impact**
- **Maintenance**: Medium - Changes to selectors require test file updates
- **Readability**: Medium - Tests less readable with raw selectors
- **Functional**: None - Tests execute successfully
- **Blocking**: No - Does not prevent production deployment

#### **Justification for Acceptance**
- Tests are functional and stable
- Refactoring requires significant effort (estimated 3-5 days)
- No functional impact on test execution
- Higher priority fixes already completed
- Can be addressed in Q2 2026 sprint

#### **Resolution Plan**

**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days  
**Assigned To**: TBD (Framework Team)  
**Target Completion**: May 15, 2026

**Implementation Steps**:
1. ✅ **Audit all direct page API calls** (identify all ~20 instances)
   - File: `tests/test_bookslot_complete_flows.py`
   - Expected count: 15-25 instances

2. ⏭️ **Extract selectors to Page Object classes**
   - Create new methods in relevant Page Objects:
     * `pages/bookslot_basicinfo_page.py`
     * `pages/bookslot_familydetails_page.py`
     * `pages/bookslot_otpvalidation_page.py`
     * `pages/bookslot_payment_page.py`
   - Follow naming convention: `verb_noun()` (e.g., `click_submit_button()`)

3. ⏭️ **Update test file to use new methods**
   - Replace direct page API calls with Page Object methods
   - Maintain test logic and assertions unchanged

4. ⏭️ **Verify test execution**
   - Run full regression: `pytest tests/test_bookslot_complete_flows.py -v`
   - Verify 100% pass rate
   - Check execution time (should remain similar)

5. ⏭️ **Update documentation**
   - Document new Page Object methods
   - Add examples to developer guide

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Zero direct page API calls in test file
- ✅ All tests pass after refactoring
- ✅ Execution time within 10% of original
- ✅ Code review approved
- ✅ Documentation updated

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Mitigation**: Incremental refactoring, comprehensive testing after each change
- **Rollback Plan**: Git revert if tests fail

### **TD-002: Duplicate Booking Flow Logic**

**Priority**: LOW  
**Category**: Code Quality  
**Status**: 🟡 ACCEPTED (Non-blocking)  
**Target Resolution**: Q2 2026 (June 2026)

#### **Problem Statement**
- **Location**: 
  * `tests/test_bookslot_complete_flows.py` (Manual test)
  * `tests/test_bookslot_complete_workflow.py` (Recorded test)
- **Issue**: Two similar booking flow implementations exist
- **Duplication**: ~80% overlap in test logic

#### **Impact**
- **Maintenance**: Low - Two files to maintain instead of one
- **Confusion**: Low - Files serve different purposes (manual vs recorded)
- **Functional**: None - Both tests execute successfully
- **Blocking**: No - Does not prevent production deployment

#### **Justification for Acceptance**
- Intentional separation (manual vs recorded workflows)
- Both serve different testing purposes
- Minimal maintenance overhead
- No functional issues
- Lower priority than other improvements

#### **Resolution Plan**

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Assigned To**: TBD (Framework Team)  
**Target Completion**: June 15, 2026

**Investigation Phase** (1 day):
1. ⏭️ **Analyze both implementations**
   - Document differences between manual and recorded flows
   - Identify unique value of each approach
   - Assess consolidation feasibility

2. ⏭️ **Decision Matrix**
   - Option A: Keep both (document purposes clearly)
   - Option B: Consolidate into single implementation with parametrization
   - Option C: Keep one, archive the other

**Implementation Phase** (1-2 days):
3. ⏭️ **Execute chosen option**
   - If consolidating: Use pytest parametrize to handle variations
   - If keeping both: Add clear documentation explaining purposes
   - If archiving: Move to `tests/archived/` with README explaining rationale

4. ⏭️ **Verification**
   - Run full regression suite
   - Verify no test coverage loss
   - Update documentation

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Clear decision documented
- ✅ No test coverage loss
- ✅ Reduced maintenance burden (if consolidating)
- ✅ Documentation updated

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Risk Level**: VERY LOW
- **Mitigation**: Thorough analysis before making changes
- **Rollback Plan**: Keep archived copy if consolidating

1. ⏭️ **Create coverage analyzer script**
   - File: `scripts/governance/page_object_coverage_analyzer.py`
   - Features:
     * Parse all Page Object files
     * Count methods per Page Object
     * Analyze test files for direct API usage
     * Generate coverage report

2. ⏭️ **Define coverage metrics**
   - **Method Count**: Total methods per Page Object
   - **Usage Frequency**: How often methods are called
   - **Direct API Usage**: Tests calling page APIs directly (violation)
   - **Coverage Score**: Percentage of tests using POM methods

**Phase 2: Baseline Establishment** (3 days)
3. ⏭️ **Run initial analysis**
   - Analyze all Page Objects
   - Analyze all tests
   - Generate baseline report

4. ⏭️ **Set coverage targets**
   - Target 1: 90% of tests use POM methods (not direct APIs)
   - Target 2: Average 10+ methods per Page Object
   - Target 3: Zero direct API calls (already tracked by TD-001)

**Phase 3: Integration** (3 days)
5. ⏭️ **Add to CI/CD pipeline**
   - Run coverage analyzer on each PR
   - Post coverage report as PR comment
   - Track trend over time

6. ⏭️ **Add to dashboard** (LT-002 dependency)
   - Display coverage metrics
   - Show trends

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Coverage analyzer tool functional
- ✅ Baseline coverage established
- ✅ Integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Coverage metrics visible in dashboard

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] `scripts/governance/page_object_coverage_analyzer.py`

## 🎯 RISK ASSESSMENT

### **Implementation Risks**

| **Risk** | **Probability** | **Impact** | **Mitigation** |
|----------|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| **Team capacity constraints** | MEDIUM | HIGH | Prioritize high-priority items; defer low-priority |
| **Pre-commit hook adoption resistance** | LOW | MEDIUM | Clear communication of benefits; provide support |
| **Technical debt resolution delays** | MEDIUM | LOW | Non-blocking debt; can defer if needed |
| **Dashboard development complexity** | LOW | LOW | Use proven tools (Grafana); start with MVP |
| **Baseline expiry causes false positives** | LOW | MEDIUM | Early review (ST-003); renew or fix before expiry |
